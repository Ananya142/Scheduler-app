* **CSS3** – Styling and responsive design
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Core functionality
* **LocalStorage API** – Data persistence
* **Font Awesome** – Icons and UI enhancements


## Getting Started

├── index.html      # Entry point
├── style.css       # Application styling

## Codebase Analysis

### Step 1: HTML (`index.html`)

* Acts as the main entry point
* Contains the `<head>` section for linking CSS, JS, and icons
* Defines layout and form structure

### Step 2: CSS (`style.css`)

* Handles layout, colors, spacing, and responsiveness
* Enhances UI/UX for post cards and scheduler views

### Step 3: JavaScript (`script.js`)

Key concepts used:

* DOM manipulation
* Event handling
* Array methods
* Date & time handling
* Form validation
* LocalStorage integration
* File handling for images
* Dynamic UI creation
* Toast messages
* Unique ID generation


## Why React is a Better Solution

React addresses these problems by:

* Virtual DOM for efficient rendering
* Centralized state management
* Reusable components
* Cleaner architecture
* Easier maintenance and scalability
* Routing support using React Router
